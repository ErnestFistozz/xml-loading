#  Upload XML to SQLite3

## What is it?
Some javascript, and xml handling

I chose the technologies that I used because they were quick and "easy".
I assumed that all the docs would have the same fields since we were using a SQL db



### Technologies

1. JavaScript
2. Node.js v8.9.4
3. SQLite3
4. Jquery
5. HTML

### Getting Started

** Make sure you have Node installed on your local machine prior to running the app.

1. unzip this to your local machine.
3. In your terminal cd to the root of this file
4.`$ npm i && npm start`
5. in your browser go to `http://localhost:8080`
6. upload a XML file
7. search by ip address
8. to stop app Ctrl + c/^c in terminal
